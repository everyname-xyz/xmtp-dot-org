# Works with XMTP

In the spirit of web3 composability, here are **just a few** of the building blocks that work well with XMTP. Building your app with these tools can help you deliver and distribute an appâ€”faster and with quality.

:::tip

**This list is not exhaustive** and is just a starting point. A highly extensible protocol like XMTP can work with more tools than those listed in each section.

:::


## Wallet connection

To connect web3 wallets to your app:

- [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)
    - Example implementation in the [XMTP React Native example app](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-react-native/blob/main/example/src/AuthView.tsx#L7)
- [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/)
    - Example implementation in the [XMTP Inbox Web app](https://github.com/xmtp-labs/xmtp-inbox-web)
- [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)

XMTP client SDKs require you to use [ethers](https://ethers.org/) or another web3 library capable of supplying an [ethers Signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/). These wallet connection tools, as well as others, provide this capability.


## Message bots

To build message bots to help with testing and user onboarding experiences:

- [XMTP Bot Starter](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-bot-starter)


## Storage

To store encrypted and encoded message payload content:

- [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/)
    - Example implementation in [`xmtp-js` remote content types](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js-content-types)
    - Tutorial: [Introducing remote media attachments](/blog/attachments-and-remote-attachments)


## Decentralized identifiers

To support decentralized identity management:

- [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) (ENS)
    - Example implementation in [xmtp-inbox-web](https://github.com/xmtp-labs/xmtp-inbox-web)
- [Coinbase cb.id](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/managing-account/coinbase-ens-support)
- [Lens](https://www.lens.xyz/)
- [Everyname](https://everyname.xyz)
    - Name and Address Middleware Protocol. Example implementation in [xmtp-inbox-web](https://github.com/johannafransn/xmtp-inbox-web/commit/dd2425fe03548248e62ef265e8c930d13af91e4f)


## Decentralized social

- [Lens](https://www.lens.xyz/)
    - Example implementation in [Lenster](https://github.com/lensterxyz/lenster)
    - Tutorial: [Build key XMTP chat features in a Lens app](/docs/client-sdk/javascript/tutorials/build-key-xmtp-chat-features-in-a-lens-app)
- [CyberConnect](https://link3.to/cyberconnect)
    - Example implementation in the [CyberConnect & XMTP Integration Demo App](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cc-xmtp-chatapp)
    - Tutorial: [Build messaging for CyberConnect profiles](/docs/client-sdk/javascript/tutorials/build-messaging-for-cyberconnect-profiles)


## Decentralized app store

To launch your own dApp stores and list any dApp, including your own:

- Polygon [dApp Store Kit](https://docs.dappstorekit.io/docs/how%20to%20use%20the%20dapp%20store%20kit/dapp-registry-management/)


## Wallet apps

XMTP can be used with EVM-compatible wallet apps that support ECDSA signing on the secp256k1 elliptic curve. These include common wallet apps such as:

- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Rainbow Wallet](https://rainbow.me/)
- Most wallets in the [WalletConnect network](https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet)

The XMTP SDK **does not** include a wallet app abstraction, as XMTP assumes that developers have a way to obtain a wallet app connection.

XMTP uses a signature from the blockchain account to [create and enable the XMTP identity](account-signatures). Specifically, XMTP identities must be generated from and associated with an Ethereum account's public address and private key. As such, a connected wallet app must be present to generate the signature and initialize the API client in the client app.

A user can generate multiple XMTP identities from the same wallet app by changing to a different blockchain account.


## Chains

XMTP works with externally owned accounts (EOAs) on Ethereum and Ethereum side-chains and L2s. 

Because all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains share the same Ethereum wallet and address format and XMTP messages are stored off-chain, XMTP is interoperable across EVM chains, including testnets. (XMTP itself does not use EVMs.) 

For example, whether a user has their wallet app connected to Ethereum or an Ethereum side-chain or L2, their private key can generate and retrieve their XMTP key pair to give them access to XMTP.

XMTP is also chain-agnostic, so multi-chain support is possible. 

Here are **just a few** of the chains supported by XMTP:
